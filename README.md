Mobile Front-end user management for October CMS.

** Update: This plugin now works independent of the Mobile & RainLab User plugin. **

# About Plugin #

This plugin is similar to the RainLab.User plugin except it’s built to work with mobile front-ends. It exposes RESTful API nodes that enable interaction with the backend thereby allowing users to sign up and login.

Tutorial and demonstration of the plugin [here](//www.youtube.com/embed/IkFzSzjoXJ0).

#### Features ####
* Completely extensible.
* Select either login via Backend or Frontend (requires [RainLab.User plugin](https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-user)) user models.

#### Coming Soon ####
* Compatible with the multiple mobile apps feature of the mobile plugin.
* Dashboard widget to provide user signup and register analytics.
* Forgot password and signing out nodes (Currently, you can do it through website only).
* Multiple Auth Schemes for better security.

### Requirements

* [Mohsin.RESTful plugin](http://octobercms.com/plugin/mohsin-rest).
